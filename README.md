# i3workswitch
Quick nearest-unused workspace switcher for i3.

### What am I looking at?
You ever wanted to switch focus to a workspace yet unoccupied, unbothered? Laziness ever got the best of you, to the point where you didn't even want to bother checking your list of workspaces for an unused number? Well, I kid you not, I got the feeling quite often. So often, I got to typing. 

In all seriousness, this peice of code can move user focus to the nearest available, and so can it move the current focused window, if you choose so. It can also do it in reverse! (Both functions, of course).

### User's manual
Since I assume you wouldn't want an option-selection window to open each time you ran the code, I made it so that you can easily access the functions of this code at your leisure. Just slap a `--reverse` on he back end of launch cmnd to initiate a reversed version of focus switching - or use the shiny new `--move` to move your current container (open window, as the normies call it) to the nearest unused and empty workspace.
